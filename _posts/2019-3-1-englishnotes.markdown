**Huawei launches new $2,600 foldable 5G phone to rival Samsung** 

Huawei Technologies Co. announced a smartphone that unfolds into a small tablet computer, potentially rendering the need to carry two separate devices obsolete.

The Mate X supports next-generation 5G networks and will cost 2, 299 euros ($2, 606) when released in the summer. When folded, the Mate X has a 6.6-inch display; but when opened out, it becomes an 8-inch tablet computer. It’s the second folding phone announced by a major manufacturer within a week. Samsung revealed the Galaxy Fold on Wednesday.

The market for smartphones is slowing, and manufacturers are scrambling to find new ways to convince consumers they should upgrade their devices. Next-generation high-speed networks are still far away from mainstream availability, so device makers are looking at new device form factors to conjure up excitement.

Huawei has been battling global scrutiny over its telecom equipment, but often overlooked is the company’s rapid growth as a smartphone manufacturer. Last year it surpassed Apple to become the world’s second-largest maker of smartphones, according to data from market research firm IDC.

Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester, said the Mate X “shows Huawei is a leader in tech innovation.” But it will be “a few years” before a significant mass of customers get their hands on 5G functionalities and foldable screens, he said.



## 长难句解析

> Huawei has been battling global scrutiny over its telecom equipment, but often overlooked is the company’s rapid growth as a smartphone manufacturer.

> 华为一直忙于应对全球范围内对其通讯设备的审查。但作为智能手机制造商，该公司的迅速发展常常被忽视。

这是由表转折的连接词 but 连成的并列句式。前半部分的关键是理解 battle的用法。battle sth.  表示“与之对抗”，而 battle over sth. 指“为...而斗争”， battling global scrutiny over its telecom equipment 字面意思就是“与全球对其通讯设备的审查作斗争“。but 后面接句子是一个倒装句，often overlooked is 被提前了，还原成普通的句式就变成 the company’s rapid growth as a smartphone manufacturer is often overlooked。
