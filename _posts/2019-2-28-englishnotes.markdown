### How sky-high rents forced people into imaginative alternatives

Renting a property in the UK can be a bleak business. The average monthly rent rose to £932 last month and in London it is even more expensive at £1, 588, according to new figures.

With spiralling rents leaving many people with barely any disposable income, let alone the means to save towards a deposit, some are now choosing alternatives.

### The older choice

Office administrator Tina Gotla-Aluri, 42, was struggling to cope with the £950 a month she was paying for her house share in Putney, south-west London, when a friend suggested Share and Care Homeshare, which matches older homeowners who have a spare room with people who can offer practical help in exchange. She now lives in Putney with a man in his 90s and pays £180 a month to the scheme.

In return, Gotla-Aluri provides companionship, goes food shopping, and cooks meals. “He is quite well travelled and food is one of the things we have bonded over, ” she says. “I cook British food like Sunday dinners and sometimes Indian or Moroccan food. It’s mutually beneficial.”

### Sitting it out

While some people house-sit for free to get a taste of luxury or a different life for a few weeks, designer Jennifer Hamley, 39, and her husband, Ben, 37, have turned it into a way to live rent-free.

The couple house-sit through TrustedHousesitters.com, which connects home and pet owners with house-sitters and costs each party £89 for an annual membership. They house-sit mainly in Brighton, taking care of pets, the home, post and watering plants.

“It is a peace of mind for many homeowners. A homeowner doesn’t need to get anyone to check in on the house, and pet owners don’t have to pay kennels, catteries or dog walkers.”

## 词义辨析

scheme, plan

scheme 这个词的本意是“**方案、计划**”，跟 plan 的区别就在于 scheme 的规模一般更大，更加系统化：A scheme is not just any plan, but a systematic plan on a large scale。它的另外一个意思是“**阴谋**”，比如说警方破获了一个洗钱团伙的阴谋：The police uncovered a scheme by a gang of money launderers. 不过在文中，这个词既不是“方案”，也不是“阴谋”，而是引申出了第三种意思，表示“**体系、制度**”，联系上下文，它指代的是 Share and Care这个合租网站。





## 长难句解析

> With spiralling rents leaving many people with [barely any disposable income], let alone [the means to save towards a deposit], some are now choosing alternatives.

> 房租的急速上涨，使得许多人几乎没有任何可支配收入，更别提想办法存够定金了，因此有些人开始选择其他的租房形式。

With spiralling rents leaving many people with barely any disposable income, 这句话属于介宾短语的结构，With A doing B, 其中 A doing B 本身描述的就是一件完整的事情，假如把介词 with 去掉，再补充一个 be 动词，那么这句话就可以独立成句，变成：Spiralling rents are leaving many people with **barely any disposable income**，急速上涨的房租，使得许多人几乎没有任何可支配的收入。

后面 let alone the means to save towards a deposit 里面，核心名词 means 平行于上面的 income，所以这句话如果接到上一句的结构中，就是：Spiralling rents are leaving many people with **no means to save towards a deposit**. 两句话连起来，意思就是，天价房租不但让人手头拮据，甚至没办法挤出一间房子定金的钱。



## 一句话总结新闻

本期《卫报》讲述了英国人面对天价租房而想出了一系列省房租的办法，其中重点讲了“与老人同住”以及“帮别人看家”，在这些新颖的节省租金的方法中，房主和租客上实质上是一种互利共赢的关系。
