## 新闻正文

South Korea's cosmetics industry,known as K-beauty,has become an Asian powerhouse andglobal phenomenon for its rigorous step-by-step regimens.

  *rigorous standards*

  *rigorous safety checks*

A YouTuBe bideo of a 7-year-old putting on lipstick,titled "I want to wear makeup like mom,"has attracted 4,3 million views,while similar videos show young girls sharing their "elementary school makeup routine" and "unboxing my Hello Kitty makeup kit"

"Form K-pop divas to K-beauty cosmetics, the market capitalizing on women's objectification has become a hyper-saturated 'red ocean' in South Korea," said Yoon-Kim of Konkuk University.

- Konkuk University  韩国建国大学

​                                                                                                                                               ——Washington Post



## 长难句解析

> For decades, academics of all stripes have pored over the impact of pressure on teenagers and young women in the West to conform with unreasonable standards for appearance and body type.

> 几十年来，各个派别的学者都在研究西方青少年和年轻女性所承受压力的影响，这些压力迫使她们去遵循外貌和体型上不合理的标准。

这个句子很长，不过它的结构很清晰。主语是 academics of all stripes ，各个派别的学者们，都 pore over the impact of pressure，钻研压力的影响；施加在谁身上的压力呢？on teenagers and young women in the West ，西方的青少年和年轻女性，迫使他们去顺应对外貌和体型不合理的标准。



## 一句话总结

本篇《华盛顿邮报》的新闻讲述了最近韩国兴起的幼儿化妆风潮，这一现象和韩国社会发达的美妆产业以及社会对美的推崇息息相关。作者同时也给出了一个不同的视角，认为这一现象是美妆集团对新兴市场的尝试。
